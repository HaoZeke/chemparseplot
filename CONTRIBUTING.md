## Development

Your contributions make this project better for everyone. Thank you for
participating!

### Local Development

Often it is useful to have [pixi](https://prefix.dev/) handle the dependencies:

```bash
pixi shell
```

A `pre-commit` job is set up on CI to enforce consistent styles. It is advisable
to set it up locally as well using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for
isolation:

```bash
# Run before committing
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
```

Note that the `readme` file is generated from `readme_src.org` via:

```bash
./scripts/org_to_md.sh readme_src.org readme.md
```

#### Tests

Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:

```bash
hatch run test
```
